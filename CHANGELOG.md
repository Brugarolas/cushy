## v0.1.2 (2023-12-18)

### Fixed

- Gooey now compiles for Windows. An indirect dependency, `appit`, also needs to
  be updated to v0.1.1. Running `cargo update` should be enough to update
  `appit`.

## v0.1.1 (2023-12-18)

This release only contains fixed links in the README. No code was changed.

## v0.1.0 (2023-12-18)

This is the initial alpha release of Gooey.
