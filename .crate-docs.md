Gooey is an experimental Graphical User Interface (GUI) crate for the Rust
programming language. It is built using [`Kludgine`][kludgine], which is powered
by [`winit`][winit] and [`wgpu`][wgpu]. It is incredibly early in development,
and is being developed for a game that will hopefully be developed shortly.

The [`Widget`][widget] trait is the building block of Gooey: Every user
interface element implements `Widget`. A full list of built-in widgets can be
found in the [`gooey::widgets`][widgets] module.

Gooey uses a reactive data model. To see [an example][button-example] of how
reactive data models work, consider this example that displays a button that
increments its own label:

```rust,ignore
// Create a dynamic usize.
let count = Dynamic::new(0_usize);

// Create a new button with a label that is produced by mapping the contents
// of `count`.
Button::new(count.map_each(ToString::to_string))
    // Set the `on_click` callback to a closure that increments the counter.
    .on_click(count.with_clone(|count| move |_| count.set(count.get() + 1)))
    // Run the button as an an application.
    .run()
```
