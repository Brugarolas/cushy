Gooey is an experimental Graphical User Interface (GUI) crate for the Rust
programming language. It is built using [`Kludgine`][kludgine], which is powered
by [`winit`][winit] and [`wgpu`][wgpu]. It is incredibly early in development,
and is being developed for a game that will hopefully be developed shortly.

The [`Widget`][widget] trait is the building block of Gooey: Every user
interface element implements `Widget`. A full list of built-in widgets can be
found in the [`gooey::widgets`][widgets] module.

Gooey uses a reactive data model. To see [an example][button-example] of how
reactive data models work, consider this example that displays a button that
increments its own label:

```rust,ignore
fn main() -> gooey::Result {
    // Create a dynamic usize.
    let count = Dynamic::new(0_isize);
    // Create a dynamic that contains `count.to_string()`
    let count_label = count.map_each(ToString::to_string);

    // Create a new button whose text is our dynamic string.
    count_label
        .into_button()
        // Set the `on_click` callback to a closure that increments the counter.
        .on_click(count.with_clone(|count| move |_| count.set(count.get() + 1)))
        // Position the button in the center
        .centered()
        // Run the application
        .run()
}
```
